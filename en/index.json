[{"categories":["Personal Blog"],"content":"WTF - A Blog? The digital (entertainment) world is overflowing with exciting content these days. In light of this fact, it may initially seem unusual to start your own blog. On the internet, you inevitably stumble upon TikTok challenges, viral short videos, and complex algorithms that only show you what aligns with your personal preferences and opinions. Their goal is well-defined: maximize user engagement and retention through clever strategies and psychological tricks to maximize revenue. So, why did I still decide to start a blog, even though it may seem like a dusty relic from bygone days? Keep reading, and Iâ€™ll tell you why.

After reading the previous paragraph, you might have gotten the impression that Iâ€™m here to raise the banner of resistance against current trends in the digital world or that my blog will become a headquarters for critics. Let me clarify right away â€“ I wonâ€™t be inciting a digital revolt against the latest developments in the online world here. My blog wonâ€™t be a hotspot for rebellions or secret conspiracies. You wonâ€™t find esoteric adventures here, and absurd conspiracy theories are definitely not my thing. This is a laid-back, digital haven, my little piece of the internet where I want to share things that interest me, and hopefully you too. In a world where oneâ€™s online presence is often controlled by tech giants, I have the need for a personal space, free from annoying ads and unnecessary gimmicks.

My First Dive into Blogging","uri":"/blog-gh-pages/en/posts/hello_world/"},{"categories":["Personal Blog"],"content":"Content One of the main driving forces behind creating this blog was the fact that I already write notes and guides on technical topics (e.g., WordPress, Laravel, Zohoâ€¦) for myself. So, why not share this information? Of course, only after Iâ€™ve polished and refined it! While keyword lists and unstructured notes might make sense to me, they might not be of any use to others. My hope is that my resources will serve not only as a handy reference for me but also be beneficial to others. If someone indeed stumbles upon my blog and finds my posts helpful, that would be a true success for me. But thatâ€™s not all. On my blog, youâ€™ll find not only tutorials but also posts on (technical) topics that fascinate me or are currently swirling around in my thought universe. Whether youâ€™re looking for practical guides and advice or just want to enjoy some good reading, I hope you find something that piques your interest.
